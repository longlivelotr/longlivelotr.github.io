*Boring Class*


    I waited for bell to ring as I sat through another boring class of mathematics. The soft drone of the teacher was trying to put me to sleep. The birds out the window chirped a simple three-note tune, and it chirped over and over again in the blazing hot sun. And I'd rather listen to that than listen to the bold-headed man in the front. The sunlight shone through the tattered curtains, and a ray shown exactly on his shiny head. The reflected light almost blinded my poor eyes.“ When we talk about solving the x in this problem...”He began. Your face is what we should talk about, I thought, it's fifth period and I'm starved. And gods, you need more hair on that head. 
    
    I winced as I straited my back which made a cracking sound. A car drove by outside and it suddenly gave me the urge to run that guy over with my dad's car. Of course I didn't dare to do so. A fly buzzed around the room and landed on the teacher's head, which was the brightest object in the room.
    
    I shifted in my seat and my chair squeaked as if it also needed a move. The sound echoed in the quiet classroom and people turned to look with bored faces. Suddenly another squeak echoed. Then a third. Suddenly all the head started moving and we started to yawn. The rounded turnip-head in the front turned and small piggy eyes scanned across the room like radar. You can imagine the face as a squashed sweet potato: lumpy, fat, and oozing oil( I know this plant doesn't ooze oil, but the teacher does.). Only sweet potatoes don't have a bold round head. Radishes do, and so did our teacher.
    
    “One minute count-down!” the guy next to me whispered and I've never felt so relieved. Silently,  we counted and we prayed. We were apart, but our minds thought as a whole. The bird sang a melody of joy, though it only chirped the same tune. Everyone, every boy and girl, prayed and waited for the sacred moment to come. Five, four, three, two, one and alas, behold! The bell rang!
    
    Today we overcame another enemy, the enemy of mankind. Let us enjoy the joy of victory and lunch.
